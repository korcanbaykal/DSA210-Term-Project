# Korcan-Baykal-DSA210-Term-Project
## Project Overview
For a long time, I have been seeing news about the increase in air pollution and its effects both in our country and around the world. However, I realized that there are many factories in the city where I live and around us. Therefore, I started to wonder how the changing number of factories over the years affects the amount of air quality and the harmful gases in the air. Also I wondered whether the air pollution where we live is highest in the hot months or in the cold months.

The plan is as follows: I will collect the annual number of factories from the provincial industrial status reports of the Ministry of Industry and Technology. At the same time I will collect 2 different harmful particle diameter(PM10, PM2.5) datas and 6 different chemical compound(SO2, CO, NO2, NOX, NO, O3) gases datas related with air pollution from the databank of the national air monitoring network of the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change. Finally, I will compare my informations and test my hypotheses.

## Data Collection
  1.** Annual number of factories: ** Provincial industrial status reports of the Ministry of Industry and Technology
      - I will collect each year's report and find the number of factory establishments per year.
      - Example report of 2021: https://www.sanayi.gov.tr/plan-program-raporlar-ve-yayinlar/81-il-sanayi-durum-raporlari/mu1602011640
  2.** Harmful particles and chemical compounds: ** databank of the national air monitoring network of the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change.
      - 2 different harmful particle diameter(PM10, PM2.5) datas.
      - 6 different chemical compound(SO2, CO, NO2, NOX, NO, O3) gases.
